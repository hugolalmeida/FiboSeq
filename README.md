# FiboSeq

# Overview

This project is a **Fibonacci Sequence Generator** built in Erlang.  
The program generates the Fibonacci sequence, displays it on the screen using formatted output, and stores the values in a list.  
It includes functions to filter the list, check its range, and search for a specific number using expressions.  
Additionally, it applies conditionals to verify if the list is empty and, if so, prompts the user to generate a new sequence by looping until valid input is provided.  
Pattern matching is used to structure the sequence generation process in a clear and efficient way.

The goal of this project is to explore Erlang’s syntax, pattern matching, recursion, and message-passing concepts while building a functional and interactive application.

# Development Environment

- **Editor/IDE:** Erlang shell and a code editor (such as VS Code or IntelliJ with Erlang plugin)
- **Language:** Erlang
- **Libraries:** No external libraries were used; the project was developed using Erlang’s standard library and built-in functions.
